# gitshortened
A collection of short useful git command bash aliases. 

## Installation
Installation is in the .gitshortened-rc file.

## Naming Scheme
Once you finish the instructions, you should be able to use the aliases.
You may wonder how it's named. Here is the naming scheme used.

### Rules:

`g` at the beginning means "git"

if two commands conflict, another letter can be added

any argument is added *after* the git command letter(s)

### Special cases:

"git commit -m" is not gcm, but gc, as -m is nearly always used
